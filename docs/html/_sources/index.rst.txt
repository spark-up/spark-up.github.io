===========
The rise of AutoML has led to almost anyone being able to perform basic ML tasks.
AutoML is very successful in data transformations, feature engineering, model building, and hyperparameter tuning.
However, one step in the workflow has received significantly less attention if any at all: `ML feature type inference`.
Therefore, the ADA lab at UCSD has created a new way to perform AutoML feature type inference with the ML Data Prep Zoo.
Using an ML-based approach, standard ML models are built and trained on a labeled benchmark dataset that is able to predict feature types
from columns with reasonable accuracy. 

Heterodyne addresses the scalability issues currently affecting Project Sorting Hat using PySpark.
