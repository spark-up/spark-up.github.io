Conclusion
==========
We have presented a brief overview of AutoML and Feature Type Inference. Our proposed 
proof-of-concept system for scalable feature type inference has been experimentally validated
with a medium-scale Spark cluster. Finally, we described limitations of this proof-of-concept
system for future work to resolve.
