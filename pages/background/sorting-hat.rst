The ADA lab at UCSD has been researching new ways to perform AutoML data preparation under 
Project SortingHat. Project SortingHat envisioned using an ML-based approach to 
automate ML data prepartion. To do this, data preparation tasks are formalized into prediction
tasks. 

ML Data Prep Zoo
================

Project SortingHat has lead to the creation of the ML Data Prep Zoo. The ML Data Prep Zoo 
is a repository containing benchmark labeled datasets and pre-trained ML models for data preparation 
tasks. The first AutoML data preparation task that was implemented was feature type inference.
