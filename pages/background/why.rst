Project SortingHat
==================
The ADA lab at UCSD has created a new way to automate ML feature type inference using the ML data prep zoo. 
The ML data prep zoo is a community-led repository that contains a benchmark labelled dataset and pre-trained models for
ML data prep task. The ML data prep zoo uses an ML-based approach by building and training standard ML models to infer column feature types from an un-seen csv with the 
benchmark labeled dataset.
